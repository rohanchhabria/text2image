# Demo App For Virtualness
This was taken from their website: https://about.virtualness.io/about-us

Our platform brings together the power of generative AI image creation tools, blockchain digital goods or NFT minting capabilities, and a social marketplace where fans can access gamification, engagement tools, trade, transact and token gate for unlocking utilities / rewards - all in one place

I identified that diffusion models are being used for their product and I thought I would present a small demo app for the same with a small application using stable diffusion.
